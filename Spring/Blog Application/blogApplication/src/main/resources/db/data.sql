For the slow and medium growers, it is not at all bad if you skip repotting. Repotting too soon can have a bad influence on the plant and its roots and you would rather avoid this!

Your green beauties need love and some of them require even more than others! They could keep you busy for hours and hours, but luckily they give you lots in return. We always encourage expanding a plant collection, but we can imagine that you don’t have more time to spend on your babies. The perfect solution that will fit your time frame perfectly is a terrarium! An eye-catcher in your interior and super easy to care for! A terrarium works as a mini ecosystem, because for example, a closed jar ensures that the temperature is slightly higher than the outside temperature. Water from the plants and soil will evaporate and these micro drops can’t go anywhere because of the closed environment. Condense on the jar will appear and these drops will fall back into the soil and on the plants. This makes sure that the plants will never have too little water and increases the humidity! The soil provides nutrients for the plants, plants grow from these nutrients, eventually some leaves will fall off and these dead leaves will bring nutrients back to the soil. This will make a never ending cycle of nutrients inside your terrarium. There are lots of plants that thrive on these conditions, so let’s name some beautiful BabyPLNTS for terrariums!', '2021-04-08'),

This has mostly to do with their air-purifying skills that benefit our respiratory system. Well you might wonder, what is this air-purifying super power and why does it help me to sleep better? The air in our homes normally contains quite a lot of substances that are not very good for us. Many plants have the ability to remove impurities from the air such as benzene, formaldehyde, and ammonia. These substances even come from our furniture and materials that we use! By adding plants to your home that remove these substances, we actually breathe in air that is a better quality and this is beneficial for our sleep.
